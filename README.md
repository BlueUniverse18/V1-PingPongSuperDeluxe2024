# V1-PingPongSuperDeluxe2024
This game is designed to play on the bus - One player uses arrow keys to move the left paddle and the other player uses trackpad, after a bit of playing the powerball will pop up and you have to play well when it does cuz it has double points
If ur Alone and have no friend I designed practice mode which allows u to play against the wall and practice ur skills with trackpad. Btw U cant beat the wall unless u break the game, so just saying, if u beat the wall the game is broken, the other 2 buttons aint working cuz I dint code them yet, I will in version 2 after I finish a golf game and a platformer, then I will improve the game, also I will add those two games to my github page too
